# Assignment 5 - Midterm 2

## Bayesian Network Structure Learning

Learn the structure of the Bayesian Network (BN) resulting from the dataset DSET4 using 
two BN structure learning algorithms of your choice.

For instance you can consider the algorithms implemented in PGMPY or any other comparable library 
(e.g. see the list of libraries listed in Lecture 7).  

Compare and discuss the results obtained with the two different algorithms. 

Also discuss any hyperparameter/design choice you had to take.
